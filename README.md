# Skateboard_machinelearning

The dataset, 'koston.csv', is created by Jared Wilbur.

The purpose of this project was to learn about the basics of machine learning. I love skateboarding and Eric Koston is one of my favorite skaters so I thought it would be fun learn more about Koston and also learn some usefull skills.  

Project Description
This machine learning project classifies famous skateboarder Eric Koston's tricks if they are performed switch or not. 
(Note: Performing a trick switch is like shooting a basketball with your non dominant hand, which is very difficult.)

The script visualizes Koston's skateboarding, preprocesses data, trains data, creates a model, and test different classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, and K Means Klustering. 

Run
This code is best executed on Kaggle as there is more comments, it is much easier to view data, and test out different classification algorithms.

Improvements and Looking back 
Some obvious flaws with ths project is the data. An important portion of the data, the 'trick' column, is lots of unique categorical. One Hot Encoding was used to handle this, but I think this affected the model's effectiveness. The data itself is also small. 

I'm also sure there are some other flaws as this is my first machine learnig model, so I'm open to learning if any one has comments or critiques!
